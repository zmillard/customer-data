# Notes:

- Utilized create-react-app for quick SAP start up
- Expereinced issues due to 2021 changes to express that affected body-parser and shifted to express-parser. There has beein a weird related issue where if I make a POST req using postman, it posts an empty object, but if I send it via axios from the FE, it posts correctly. 
- PUT and POST need forms, would add if I had more time.

Due to time limitations, I was not able to get to the desired level of test coverage or "prettiness", as well as hosting.
